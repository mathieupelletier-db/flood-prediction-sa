# MAGIC # 03 - Gold features + hybrid labels (with rainfall scenarios)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Outputs three gold tables:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * `gold_h3_features(h3, terrain + precip climatology)` - one row per H3 cell.
# MAGIC * `gold_h3_training(h3, features..., scenario_24h_mm, label)` - the
# MAGIC   **scenario-expanded** training set: each cell is replicated for every
# MAGIC   discrete 24-hour rainfall scenario (e.g. 10, 30, 60, 100, 150, 200 mm) with
# MAGIC   a synthetic label that depends on both terrain and rainfall, so the model
# MAGIC   actually learns the rainfall effect.
# MAGIC * `gold_h3_labels(h3, label_real)` - hold-out real 2017/2019 flood label
# MAGIC   used only for validation / overlay.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Parameter `scenarios_24h_mm` is a CSV string of rainfall scenarios shared with
# MAGIC notebook 04 and the app so they all use the same partitions.
